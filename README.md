# Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTM
## We use encoder-decoder format with CNN + BiDirectional LSTM. Deep layers are stacked or have residual connections.
### This is a partial implementation of the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3115432) by Wang *et al.* published in 2018 in ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications.
### In addition we perform analysis of various implementation details.


**Note:** This is a work in progress. I will explain the details in a separate blog post as well. This directory is public as the work is in progress. kindly offer your valuable suggestions, if possible.
